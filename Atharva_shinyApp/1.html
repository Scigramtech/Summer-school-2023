<h3>Lithium ion batteries</h3>

<br/>
<p>Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in portable electronics (smartphones, laptops), electric vehicles, and grid storage systems due to their high energy density, low self-discharge rate, and long cycle life.

<p>The basic principle of operation of a lithium-ion battery involves the movement of lithium ions between the anode and cathode through the electrolyte, which enables the storage and release of electrical energy. During discharge, lithium ions move from the anode to the cathode, releasing energy, and during charging, lithium ions move from the cathode to the anode, storing energy. The graphite anode provides a stable and reversible host for lithium ions, while the metal oxide cathode allows for high cell voltage and energy density. The organic solvent-based electrolyte enables the transport of lithium ions between the electrodes while maintaining high cell performance.
