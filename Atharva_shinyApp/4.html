<h3>Lithium ores:</h3> 

<p> Lithium ores are found in several countries around the world, with the largest reserves located in Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina in South America. Other significant lithium-producing countries include Australia, China, and the United States. Lithium is primarily extracted from brine deposits and hard rock ores. Brine deposits are found in salt flats or salt pans, while hard rock ores are found in pegmatites, which are igneous rocks that contain large crystals. The Greenbushes Lithium mine in Western Australia is one of the largest hard rock lithium mines in the world.
