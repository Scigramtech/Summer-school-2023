Aditya Phadtare studies in The Bishop's School, Camp, Pune. His hobbies include football and chess. In this project, he has worked on Nuclear Power plants in India. Here, he have plotted the data of production by countries over the years and location of the plants. During the project, he worked on this data in Mathematica and R programming language. He also explored geocomputing in QGIS.

## Various Sources of Energy

The various sources of energy include **Hydroenergy, Wind Energy, Solar Energy, Biomass, Biofuel Energy, Geothermal Energy, Ocean Energy, Hydrogen** and ***Nuclear Energy*****.**

## Nuclear Power

Nuclear Power is generated by nuclear reaction. It is used to produce produce electricity . Nuclear reactions involve changes in the nucleus of an atom. In a nuclear reaction the amount of protons and neutrons may change. Nuclear reactions may also take place due to the splitting or merging of atoms.

Nuclear reaction may be classified into two groups:

1.  Fusion takes place when two lighter nuclei combine to form a heavier on. This process occurs in stars.

2.  Fission takes place when two heavier nuclei split in two lighter nuclei. This releases a large amount of energy, thus is used nuclear power plant.

## Nuclear Power in India

Nuclear power is the fifth main source of electricity in India. The most important raw-material for nuclear reactions found in India is thorium. The nuclear reactors in India produce about an average of 43TWh (Terawatt per hour) which constitutes to about 3.11% of total power generation in India. However, the power consumption of India is about 1282TWh. India produces a total of 2.56% of electricity in the world from nuclear power.

India had a up a well drawn plan for nuclear power plants but the Fukushima nuclear disaster created many anti-nuclear protests in India. There were a number of protests against Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project in Maharashtra and Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant which was in collaboration with the Russian Federation of Nuclear Power called 'Atomstroyexport'.

India is making advances in fields of thorium which may make it a little bit self-independent on the basis of nuclear reactions.
